# Notes for our self

## TODO list
- ~~make document with the template~~
- insert links to our datasets
- we should look at the papers again for inspiration and documentation for how to improve our model maybe.  
- we should find a way to load the data in the code and not by assuming it is already downloaded maybe  
- hvilke modeller skal vi have med i vores rapport? Conf Matrix. Udvikling i accuracy?
- Make model with learning rate scheduler <-- ak does
- make model_aug3 and runs before thursday <-- anna
- unfreeze layer 3 and layer 4 only <-- wil do
- start på noget rapport noget <-- stinna
- lav noget setup til at compare modeller på feeder data <- stinna evt. 
- ...

### Report TODO
- write intro
- write related work
- write methods
    - figure out network architecture
    - describe datasets
    - experiments ect
- write results
- results compared to basepaper
- discussion
- ~~tjek references work~~

# Official describtion of Project 
## Requirements  
   - Your project should involve pixels of visual data in some form.  
   - You must train a neural network model, evaluate it and perform experiments to improve its performance.  
   - When designing your project, keep the deep learning workflow in mind:  
   -  -    Acquire and prepare a dataset for deep learning  
   -    -  Set up an appropriate deep learning model (i.e., a neural network) to solve the task at hand  
   - - Train and test your model with the correct evaluation metrics  
   -  -   Perform motivated experiments to improve your model's performance  
   -   -  Explain your results  
   - You should demonstrate that you are familiar with all of the above.  

Final report submission no later than Sunday 8th December

## Report
- Use this arXiv template for your report.    
-    Report should be structured like a research paper:  
- -  Abstract  
- -  Introduction (Includes motivation and objectives of your project. Be realistic and be specific!)  
-  - Related work (Summarize at least 2-3 key references and discuss how they relate to your project)  
-   - Methods (What did you do and how? Describe network architecture, data set, experiments, etc.)  
-   - Results (Objectively summarize your results and compare to your baseline model and/or the papers covered in your related work section)  
-   - Discussion (How well did you do? What worked? What didn’t work?)  
-    Final report between 6-8 pages including pictures/figures. Stay within the limits, and avoid putting a ton of stuff into an appendix, because I won't read it. 

## Code
You must hand in your project source code to document that you did the work yourselves. A link to Google Colab or GitHub is fine, but you can also upload the code as a file. 
    If possible, please provide code to download your dataset. Please do not upload your data!
