# Ideas n shit

**Anne's foreslag til fremgang** 
1. Train clean images  
	1.1. Test on clean test set  
	1.2 Try to test on noisy test
2. w. noisy train set â€”> transfer learning or fewshot  
	2.1. test on noisy  
	2.2 test on clean

* **data augmentation**:  
blur, fish eye lense, occlusion, 

* **transfer learning**:  
  ResNet somehow,  
  what pre-stuff do they do

* **measure stuff**:  
  loss function ,  
  how to plot stuff
