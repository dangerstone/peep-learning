# Peep Learning: Species classification of garden bird feeder images üê¶

**Group 1: Anna Hallenberg, Anne Kirstine Overgaard, & Stinna Danger**

# Project description
The goal of our project is to build a classifier to identify garden bird species and assess its applicability to image data from bird feeder cameras, which is relevant for data sorting in, for instance, conservation research and biodiversity monitoring. We will use the following three datasets:
* Bird feeder images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronanreilly/birdfeeder-images-and-video-clips
* *UK Garden Birds: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davemahony/20-uk-garden-birds

\* *For the scope of this project, we will consider the species, blue tit, chaffinch, coal tit, goldfinch, great tit, robin, and starling. We will use the subset of this dataset containing images of the species we are considering in this project.*

We will train our model on dataset 2, which contain images of the bird species. We will then investigate the model‚Äôs performance when tasked with classifying the bird feeder images in data set 1, which are retrieved from wild cameras.
To build our model, we will use transfer learning using the ResNet-architecture and expect to make some layers of the model trainable, allowing it to adjust to the specific task of classifying birds. We also expect to use data augmentation to prevent overfitting, and will investigate loss curves for the training and validation data. We are interested in identifying patterns and pitfalls of the model and, to this end, we will consider the classifier‚Äôs confusion matrix and F-score and perform qualitative assessments of misclassed images.

TODO next step

hvis vi bare k√∏rer den s√• virker den fint p√• validation
s√•
  - k√∏r p√• test set og se om den virker
  - se om den virker p√• feeder data
  - tilf√∏j noget augmentation 
  - skal man normalisere feeder og test data?



  what did we do 07/11/24
  - trained model from scratch on full traning and validation set, first freezing all but the last layer, then fine tuning by unfreezing all layers
  - first training with 10 epochs took 18min on device 
    - It got around
    - Train Loss: 0.4841 Acc: 0.9150
    - Val Loss: 0.3323 Acc: 0.9904
  - Second training with 6 epochs took around 30min on device
    - It got around
    - Train Loss: 0.0237 Acc: 0.9964
    - Val Loss: 0.0522 Acc: 0.9808
    - At the last epoch, the validation accuracy was slightly worse than in the fifth epoch
  - K√∏rte det p√• test dataloader
    - Accuracy 94.28571428571428
    - den havde sv√¶rrest ved greatTit som den troede var coalTit
  - k√∏rte den p√• feederData, makeAll tog 25 min i sig selv

  - e
  - so next try and add augmentation i hvert fald, 
    - tjek evt papers igennem igen og se om der er noget gode faglige ideer vi kan bruge, s√• vi ogs√• kan argumentere for hvorfor vi g√∏r det og hvad vi g√∏r
